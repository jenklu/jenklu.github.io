In November & December of 2023, I had a few too many Friday/Saturday nights and happy hours that led
to slow-recovery hangover days. Not anything close to "drinking every night", but I figured it was
a good year to jump on the hype train and give Dry January a shot.

## Impact on drinking

Going into the month, I knew I had a Friday-Sunday long weekend golf trip where it would be tough to
avoid alcohol...so I just decided to skip dry January for those days. Besides that, I consumed two
alcoholic drinks. The first was out at dinner at [Semma](https://www.semma.nyc/) a few days into
January. My GF Annie and I were so focused on all the food options that when the waiter asked
"Anything to drink?", by force of habit I frantically flipped the menu to the cocktails and ordered
the first tequila drink I saw. I realized my mistake when the the drink arrived a few minutes later, &
Annie was quick to point out "You're doing Dry January, right ðŸ‘€?". But I wasn't going to let an $18
cocktail go to waste, so I just drank it.

The other time was watching the CFB championship at a bar. The friend I was watching with encouraged
me to drink with him, and I felt weird sitting at a bar for 3h without ordering a drink (we did eat
dinner), so I drank one light beer.

The central alcohol-specific takeaways I had were:

1. It's easy for me not to drink in most situations. Working a bit late at the office or eating a
   standard weekday dinner, I had 0 desire to drink anything (aside from wine Annie occasionally
   cooks Italian food with).
2. You hear stories about "I stopped drinking and instantly felt 10x better!". That was not me.
   I didn't notice a physical difference at all aside from less time hungover.
3. It's hard for me not to drink in certain social situations like bars/clubs/sit down dinners.
4. I already knew this, but Damp January really nailed it home: the NYC social scene (or at least my
   slice of it) is _heavily_ alcohol based. Whether with coworkers/friends at a bar, or Annie and me
   figuring out an activity after a dinner out, not drinking felt like a damper on doing stuff.
5. I don't really feel like I need to drink less - going out 1-3x a week doesn't seem to impact my
   physical health much, and not doing it just makes things less fun for the most part.

## Cold turkey experiments

The other recent experiment I've done similar to this was quitting Instagram Reels. Unlike alcohol,
I was **heavily** addicted Reels for a month or two in 2023. I found myself coming home after work
and spending hours just sitting on the couch scrolling through endless fast-food-content videos.
After trying and failing to use screen time to limit usage, I decided to just uninstall Instagram.
I was sad to miss Stories and the occasional DMs with friends, but it didn't feel like the end of
the world. After a month and a half or so, I redownloaded Instagram to see the stuff I missed aside
from Reels, and interestingly also feel like I've cured the Reels addiction. I no longer find myself compulsively opening Instagram, and can easily pull myself away after looking at a Reel or two.

While the alcohol experiment wasn't quite as 100% positive as when I quit reels, there was a
parallel between the two experiences. I enjoyed testing my willpower to cold-turkey quit a habit
with some unhealthy aspects, even if the habit isn't all bad. So I'm gonna keep trying cold-turkey
months for at least the next two of 2024:

**February**: No sweets. I'd gotten into a pretty bad habit of having some kind of sweet 2x/day,
with my afternoon coffee and then at night after dinner, which is definitely too often to be healthy.
But wow, sugar addiction is a real thing. So far this has been the hardest one to kick yet.

**March**: Ambitious, but I'm going to see if I can do no caffeine. I like caffeine, and frankly I
think it's almost surely a net positive for me, but I just want to see what life is like without it.
