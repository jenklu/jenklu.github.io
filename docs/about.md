I'm a technology brother living in NYC and building DevOps for PLCs at [Copia Automation](https://copia.io) (as of September 2023).

Before that, I worked on the [Bluetooth stack for Google's Fuchsia operating system](https://fuchsia.dev), focusing mostly on Bluetooth Low Energy & security. I worked out of Google's SF office for a while before spending my last few months at Google NYC.

I interned at [DraftKings](https://draftkings.com) on the Daily Fantasy stats team, [Silicon Labs](https://siliconlabs.com) writing code for hardware testbeds, and the [MGH Martinos Center](https://www.martinos.org/) helping build multi-channel MRI arrays.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing golf and guitar, seeing new places, spending time outside, and aimlessly scrolling through Twitter.
